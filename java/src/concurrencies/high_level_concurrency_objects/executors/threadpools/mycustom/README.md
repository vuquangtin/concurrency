# My Custom Thread Pool Executor in Java

ThreadPoolExecutor is a feature added by java concurrent api to maintain and reuse threads efficiently , so that our programs donâ€™t have to worry about creating and destroying threads and focus on the core functionality. I have created a custom thread pool executor to get better understanding of how thread pool executor would work .

Functionality :

 * It maintains a fixed thread pool ,and creates threads and start the threads even if no task is submitted whereas ThreadPoolExecutor creates threads on demand , i.e. whenever a runnable is submitted to pool and the number of threads are less than core pool size .
 * In ThreadPoolExecutor, we provide a waiting queue ,where new runnable task waits when all threads are busy running existing task. Once the queue is filled , new threads will be created up to maximum pool size. In MyThreadPool , i am storing the runnable in a linked list , so every task will wait in the list and it is unbounded , so no usage of maxPoolSize in this .
 * In ThreadPoolExecutor , we use Future Objects to get the result from task , future.get() method will block if the result is not available , or we use CompletionService . In MyThreadPoolExecutor , i have created a simple interface called ResultListener , user has to provide a implementation of this as to how he wants the output to be processed . After every task is completed , the ResultListener will get callback with the output of task or error method will be called in case of any exception.
 * When shutdown method is called , MyThreadPoolExecutor will stop accepting new tasks and complete the remaining tasks .
 * I have provided very basic functionality as compared to ThreadPoolExecutor , i have used simple thread mechanism like wait() , notify() , notifyAll(), and join().
 * Performance wise it is similar to ThreadPoolExecutor , some times better in some cases. Do let me know if you find any interesting results or ways to improve it .

```

you can implement this class as you want to get back and process the result returned by tasks.

```java
package threadpools.mycustom;

/**
 * 
 * 
 * @author EMAIL:vuquangtin@gmail.com , tel:0377443333
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/vuquangtin/concurrency">https://github.com/

 *
 */
public class DefaultResultListener implements ResultListener<Object> {

	@Override
	public void finish(Object obj) {

	}

	@Override
	public void error(Exception ex) {
		ex.printStackTrace();
	}

}

```
For example this class will add the number returned by tasks .

```java
package threadpools.mycustom;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

/**
 * ResultListener class to keep track of total matched count
 * 
 * @author EMAIL:vuquangtin@gmail.com , tel:0377443333
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/vuquangtin/concurrency">https://github.com/
 *      vuquangtin/concurrency</a>
 *
 */

public class MatchedCountResultListener<V> implements ResultListener<V>

{

	/**
	 * matchedCount to keep track of the number of matches returned by submitted
	 * task
	 */
	AtomicInteger matchedCount = new AtomicInteger();

	/**
	 * this method is called by ThreadPool to give back the result of callable
	 * task. if the task completed successfully then increment the matchedCount
	 * by result count
	 */
	@Override
	public void finish(V obj) {
		// System.out.println('count is '+obj);
		matchedCount.addAndGet((Integer) obj);
	}

	/**
	 * print exception thrown in running the task
	 */
	@Override
	public void error(Exception ex) {
		ex.printStackTrace();
	}

	/**
	 * returns the final matched count of all the finished tasks
	 * 
	 * @return
	 */
	public int getFinalCount() {
		return matchedCount.get();
	}
}

```
