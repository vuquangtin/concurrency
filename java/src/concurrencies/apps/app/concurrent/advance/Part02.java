	Java threading model introduce some problem domain, such as -
	 Reading problems
	 -----------------
	 If a thread reads a memory location while another thread writes to it,
	 - what value will the first thread end up reading?
	 -- The old value?
	 -- The value written by the second thread?
	 Or a value that is a mix between the two?
	 Writing problems
	 ------------------
	 Or, if two threads are writing to the cognate memory location simultaneously,
	 what value will be left when they are done? The value written by the first thread?
	 The value written by the second thread? Or a mix of the two values written?
	 So we could solve above problem by allowing only one thread to access our code block at a time!
	 Synchronization: Introduction <we will know more later>
	 ========================================================
	 Synchronization refers to a mechanism to execute only one task/code_block at a time. Synchronization is implemented with
	 "synchronized" keyword. It could only be applied on methods or a code block but not on any variable.
	 i.e.
	 public synchronized void doX(){
		 count = 0;
		 count++;
	 }
	 ----Is equivalent to following one----
	 public void doX(){
	  synchronized(this){
		  count = 0;
		  count++;
	  }
	 }
		-------- OR equivalent ----------
	 public void doX(){
	 Object myObject = new Object();
	 synchronized(myObject){
	    count = 0;
	    count++;
	  }
	 }
	 Here, "this/myObject" is called a Monitor object. In a synchronized method, default Monitor is "this"/current_instance.
	 With a monitor object we create a lock state for that object so that only one thread could pass that synchronize
	 method/block at a time.
	 Note:
	 --------
	 - In JVM, "every object" and "class" are logically associated with a monitor.
	 - For objects, the associated monitor protects data locked on the object's instance variables. ie. Any object's instance
	 i.e.
	 Object myObject = new Object();
	 synchronized(myObject){..}
	 - For classes,the monitor protects data locked on the class's class variables. ie. String.class
	i.e.
	 synchronized(String.class){..}
	 Now run both NonSynchronizationDemo and SynchronizationDemo. NonSynchronizationDemo has mixed order of printing!
	 While SynchronizationDemo prints complete block together from each thread, in other words it just executes thread's
	 synchronized block one at a time for each thread.
	 Notes (from SynchronizationDemo)
	 --------------------------------
	 - Synchronization "does not" execute the task orderly.
	 - It sometime prints thread-1 before thread-0 and other time reversely. Run it multiple times to see the difference!
	 - It just let synchronized blocks to be accessed by one thread at a time.
	 Thread synchronization vs monitor vs lock (Important basic)
	 ============================================================
	 Monitor:
	 ---------------
	 Monitor is a generic (common in various language) concept in multi-threading scenarios. In Java, for example -
	 Object myObject = new Object();
	 synchronized(myObject){
	  count = 0;
	  count++;
	 }
	 Here "myObject" is a "Monitor object" which handles Synchronization. And
	 "{
	 count = 0;
	 count++;
	 }" is called a "monitor region".
	 So a Monitor = monitor object + monitor region.
	 Lock (It's sometimes called "Mutex"):
	 ---------------------------------------
	 A lock is:
	 - A flag/status/state of a monitor object
	 - "Hidden code block inside JVM" that cause the lock state
	 Suppose, in practical term, we are said: "Lock that door with a lock". So what is a lock?
	 => Ans: Above, a lock refers to a hard object and it also refers to a bound state of a door
	 Similarly, In threading -
	 A lock is a flag/status/state (and the hidden code block that make the lock flag) of the respective monitor object.
	 Simply,
	 Room + door = Monitor
	 door's lock = monitor's lock
	 Here, in "synchronized(myObject){..}", when the code enters the monitor region then we could say -
	 "monitor object is now locked" OR "monitor owns the lock" OR "monitor acquired the lock"
	 So finally, a synchronization mechanism is done by a lock(hidden code block) which makes a "lock" flag/status
	 on a monitor object covering the monitor region so that only one thread could pass the monitor region at a time.
	 Synchronization:
	 -------------------
	 [Just to let us know some important theoretical terms]
	 Java's monitor supports two kinds of thread synchronization:
	 1. Mutual exclusion : done via object_lock/mutex
	 2. Cooperation : done via wait/notify (we'll learn later parts)
	 Mutual exclusion
	 -----------------
	 It is supported in the Java virtual machine via object locks, enables multiple threads to independently work on
	 shared data without interfering with each other.
	 Cooperation
	 ------------
	 In the Java virtual machine via the wait and notify methods of class Object, enables threads to work together towards a common goal.
	 Note:
	 ------
	 In this tutorial we will sometimes use both lock and a monitor interchangeably to make things easier to understand.
	 i.e."a lock"==="a monitor object"
