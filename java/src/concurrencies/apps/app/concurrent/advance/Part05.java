	/*-
	Cross thread signaling: wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
	======================================================
	When multiple threads become dependent on the completion of tasks among them then we need to implement
	some sort of mechanism to signal those threads to cause the dependant task to wait until precedent tasks are finished.
	A common way is to declare a global boolean flag and then continuously check whether the task is finished or not.
	i.e:
	boolean isInitialTaskRunning = true; //global
	Then in a thread check:
	while(isInitialTaskRunning){
	//do nothing //This is called busy waiting
	}
	//Do your dependent task now
	However, busy waiting doesn't make a very efficient utilization of the CPU. As an alternative we have java-builtin: wait/notify/notifyAll methods from Object class.
	Wait/Notify/NotifyAll
	----------------------
	- wait() causes a thread to sleep and notify() wakes it up
	- The waiting thread would call wait() and the notifying thread would call notify()
	- notifyAll() method will wake all waiting/sleeping/inactive threads
	- wait/notify must be synchronized with same lock/monitor object
	- We will not use wait/notify directly but via a class (this is not compulsory but it make things easier) ie. WaitNotifierOne
	[ Class WaitNotifierOne ]
	- Waiting thread would call doWait() and notifying thread would call doNotify()
	- The moment we execute the line 21, calling thread goes to sleep and releases the lockObject so that other threads may use the lock
	- When another thread calls doNotify() or the moment line 50 is executed - waiting thread wakes up, acquires the lock and executes line 22.
	Problems
	-----------
	1. If we somehow call doNotify()/notify() before we call doWait/wait() then the waiting thread will always be
	   in waiting state unless another notify call is executed. This is called "missed signal" problem. This issue is solved
	   in WaitNotifierTwo class.
	2. Sometimes a waiting thread is get waked up without notify() method being called. This is a natural JVM phenomenon.
	   Its called "Spurious Wake ups". This issue is handled in WaitNotifierThree class.
	Class "WaitNotifierThree" is our final waitNotifier class.
	A real-world wait/notify is exampled in Part5 class. Check it out, run it!! We are done!
	Thread Join
	=====================
	If we want to wait till a thread completely finish (While wait/notify handles modular dependencies) its life cycle the we will
	need to use threadInstance.join().
	i.e: Check out ThreadJoinTest class.
	Congratulation! We are done with this part!
