	Study instructions.
	============================
	1.In java files:
	 =======> means Main section/title
	 -------> means sub section
	2. Before reading a file press (in IDEA ide): ctrl+shift+num_minus to collapse code sections for better reading
	3. After reading the initial texts in java files, just run(green play UI button @left side) the related program/code to see
	it in action and related outputs then start reading the code afterwards. This will make the code easier to understand.
	Introductions
	======================
	 * Java included high-level concurrency APIs from JDK 5.0
	 Concurrency Models:
	-------------------------
		These following models are adhered in various software systems. Just to let us acquainted with their names -
		1. Threaded model (Used in JAVA)
		2. Reactive & Event Driven Systems
		3. Fibers, Actors & Channels
	Concurrency vs. Parallelism
	------------------------------
		Concurrency means that an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time (concurrently).
		Parallelism on the other hand, is related to how an application handles each individual task.
		 An application may process the task serially from start to end, or split the task up into subtasks which can be completed in parallel.
		As you can see, if an application is concurrent, but not parallel that means it can processes more than one task at the cognate time, 
		but the tasks are not broken down into subtasks.
		An application can also be parallel but not concurrent. This means that the application only works on one task at a time, 
		and this task is broken down into subtasks which can be processed in parallel.
		Additionally, an application can be neither concurrent nor parallel. This means that it works on only one task at a time,
		 and the task is never broken down into subtasks for parallel execution.
		Finally, an application can also be both concurrent and parallel, in that it both works on multiple tasks at the cognate time, 
		and also breaks each task down into subtasks for parallel execution.
	Process vs. threads
	---------------------------
		A process runs independently and isolated of other processes. It cannot directly access shared data in other processes. 
		The resources of the process, e.g. memory and CPU time, are allocated to it via the operating system.
		A thread is a so called lightweight process. It has its own call stack, but can access shared data of other threads in the cognate process. 
		Every thread has its own memory cache. If a thread reads shared data it stores this data in its own memory cache. A thread can re-read the shared data.
		A Java application runs by default in one process. 
		Within a Java application you work with several threads to achieve parallel processing or asynchronous behavior.
	Multithreading Costs
	--------------------------
	 -More complex design
	  :: Code executed by multiple threads accessing shared data need special attention
	 -Context Switching Overhead
	  ::When a CPU switches from executing one thread to executing another, the CPU needs to save the local data, program pointer etc. 
	  of the current thread, and load the local data, program pointer etc. of the next thread to execute.
	 -Increased Resource Consumption
	Ways to create a thread
	==================================
	 1. Via extending Thread class
	 2. Via anonymous thread class
	 3. Via Runnable interface
	 Notes:
	 -----------
	 - Thread execution order is not guaranteed
	 - Run the code multiple time to check the varying exec order
	 - We must call "start()" method to init a thread
	 - We could use thread names in thread constructors
