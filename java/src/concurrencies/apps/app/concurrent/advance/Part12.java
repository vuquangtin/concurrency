	Executor service and Thread pool:
	=========================================
	Up until now, we were using raw/low-level "Thread" class and it's "start" method to start and execute a
	runnable tasks. However, in production scenarios we will use high-level "Executor" class to
	maintain multiple threads via Thread pool(=threads collection) mechanism.
	Let's see an example first:
	Runnable task = new MyRunnable();
	Thread thread = new Thread(task);
	thread.start();
	~~~~~~~~~~ IS EQUIVALENT TO ~~~~~~~~~~
	ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8); //8=Max concurrent worker(non-main) threads
	Runnable task = new MyRunnable();
	executor.execute(task);
	Advantage of Executors( vs threads):
	-------------------------------------
	- Light on cpu/ram and reuses threads: Its costly to create a new thread every time to process a task.
	- Makes managing threads easy and less error prone.
	- Graceful shutting down of threads can be achieved via Executor shutdown.
	Initiation of executor thread pool:
	------------------------------------
	ExecutorService(or Executor) can be created by following static methods.However, we could also use constructors from
	ExecutorService class.
	i.e.
	1. ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); //Set fixed amount of thread to be run simultaneously.
	Similarly via:
	2. Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); //Just start a single task via a single thread at a time
	3. Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10); // If we need to start our tasks after certain period of time
	4. Executors.newWorkStealingPool();  //Use Fork-join framework model (we'll learn later in this part)
	5. Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); //Use one thread for each task, all at once. Normally, it should be avoided.
	and a few others.
	Starting task vai ExecutorService:
	-------------------------------------
	There are a few different ways to delegate/distribute tasks for execution to an ExecutorService:
	ie. ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
	1. es.execute(Runnable); //just execute/start the runnable task; returns void
	2. es.submit(Runnable); //Return "Future" class's instance
	ie.
	Future future = es.submit(Runnable);
	future.get(); //It will cause the thread to wait till the submitted task is finished (Similar to: thread.join() )
	3. es.submit(Callable); //Accept Callable interface(Equivalent to Runnable but return result from call method) and return Future object
	ie.
	Callable myCallable = new Callable(){
	 public Object call() throws Exception {
	  //Do task here
		 return "done!";
	 }
	}
	Future future = es.submit(myCallable);
	future.get(); //Waits and returns "done!" result
	Special methods:
	--------------------
	Following methods do our common tasks more concisely for convenience. ie.
	ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
	List<Callable> callableList = new ArrayList();//Suppose, its our source callable/tasks List
	1. es.invokeAll(callableList);
	- Executes all the callable-s/tasks for us, wait till all the tasks finish their execution and then return list of
	"Future" objects for us. So its an all-in-one package for us to get the tasks done.
	2. es.invokeAny(callableList);
	- Executes and returns the first completed task and cancel others on-return.
	ExecutorService shutdown:
	----------------------------
	Following ways we could shutdown a executor pool when we have done our work.
	1.  es.shutdown();
	- Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed
	- Wait for active tasks but cancel waiting tasks
	- No new tasks will be accepted by ExecutorService after this command.
	2. es.shutdownNow(); //Returns List<Runnable>
	- Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks
	- Halts the processing of waiting tasks
	- Returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution.
	- No new tasks will be accepted by ExecutorService after this command.
	3. es.awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
	- Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is interrupted,
	whichever happens first.
	- Returns "true" if executor has done its work set and "false" if termination happens by timeout
	Checkout our Part12 class for all these implementations!
	Fork/Join Framework / ForkJoinPool:
	======================================
	Included in JAVA-7, this framework/thread-pool is specially used for "Recursive/divide-conquer" type tasks.
	However, in general situations - instead of ThreadPoolExecutor we could also use ForkJoinExecutor.
	ie.
	ExecutorService eService =  Executors.newWorkStealingPool(); //In this case, default no of threads is equivalent to no of processors
	eService.submit(Runnable/Callable); //everything else are similar to those of ThreadPoolExecutor
	Proper way to wait for ExecutorService to finish its task queue:
	==================================================================
	1. If number of task/callable/runnable is known + wait till task completely finishes, use any one of the following -
	 - future.get()
	 - executorService.invokeAll()
	 - CountDownLatch (checkout Part10)
	2. If number of task is known + wait gracefully with a time-out in case of deadlock scenarios.
	So, you wouldn't have to wait forever.
	es.shutdown();
	 es.awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
	3. If number of task is not known before hand (ie. dynamic task submission)
	 - use Phaser class (Checkout Part10)
	Threads factory:
	========================
	If we want to change the name/priority/daemon or other attributes of threads used in ExecutorService then
	we need to use a custom ThreadFactory class.
	ie.
	// We could create a sub class by implementing ThreadFactory interface
	ThreadFactory factory = new ThreadFactory() { //We used Anonymous class for simpler demonstration
	int count = 0;
	public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
			 Thread t = Executors.defaultThreadFactory().newThread(r);
			 t.setName("my_thread-"+count);
	   t.setPriority(5);
			 t.setDaemon(true);
	     count++;
			 return t;
	 }
	};
	ExecutorService exec = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4, factory);
	exec.submit(runnable/callable);
