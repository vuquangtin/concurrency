  &quot;I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the
  design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform
  in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of
  these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a
  subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.&quot;<br>

  &quot;For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's
  Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that
  effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <i><b>Java
  Concurrency in Practice</b></i> provides you with the concepts and techniques
  needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and
  tomorrow's--systems.&quot;<br>

  &quot;This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise
  way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is
  filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every
  day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now
  that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book
  will show you how to do it.&quot;<br>
