/***
 * Java program to print numbers using threads and wait notify is very similar
 * to the example above except that there is a condition for wait now
 * (while(number % 3 != threadNumber)). Unless the assigned thread number is not
 * equal to the remainder of the number division by 3, thread is made to wait.
 * 
 * Only when the assigned thread number is equal to the remainder of the number
 * division thread prints the number and notifies other waiting threads so that
 * one of them can enter the synchronized block.
 * 
 * Another interesting thing in the code is this condition- while (number <
 * PrintNumbers.MAX_NUMBERS â€“ 2). Why check for two less than the required
 * number? It is because loop will anyway run for all the three threads and for
 * value 8 itself one thread will increment it to 9 and another to 10.
