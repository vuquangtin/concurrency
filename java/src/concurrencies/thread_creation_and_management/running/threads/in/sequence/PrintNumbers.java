/***
 * Print Numbers Sequentially Using Three Threads in Java This post shows how
 * you can write a program in Java to print numbers in sequence using three
 * threads. If there are three threads T1, T2, T3 then numbers should be printed
 * alternatively by these threads in the following manner-
 * 
 * T1- 1 T2- 2 T3- 3 T1- 4 T2- 5 T3- 6 .. .. ..
 * 
 * Printing numbers using 3 threads â€“ Java program In the program each thread is
 * assigned a number (0, 1 and 2 respectively). Before thread prints a number,
 * each number is divided by 3 and the thread which has an assigned number equal
 * to the remainder of this division is eligible to print the number.
 * 
 * For example-
 * 
 * if number % 3 ==0 Then T1 prints the number if number % 3 ==1 Then T2 prints
 * the number if number % 3 ==2 Then T3 prints the number
 * 
 * This program for printing numbers in sequence using threads can be written
 * using only synchronized keyword or it can be written using wait, notify,
 * notifyAll methods for inter thread communication.
