/***
 * Printing Odd and Even Numbers Alternatively 5.1. Using wait() and notify()
 * 
 * We will use the discussed concepts of synchronization and inter-thread
 * communication to print odd and even numbers in ascending order using two
 * different threads.
 * 
 * In the first step, weâ€™ll implement the Runnable interface to define the logic
 * of both threads. In the run method, we check if the number is even or odd.
 * 
 * If the number is even, we call the printEven method of the Printer class,
 * else we call the printOdd method:
 * 
 * 
 * The first thread will be the odd thread, hence we pass false as the value of
 * the parameter isEvenNumber. For the second thread, we pass true instead. We
 * set the maxValue to 10 for both threads, so that only the numbers from 1
 * through 10 are printed.
 * 
 * We then start both the threads by calling the start() method. This will
 * invoke the run() method of both threads as defined above wherein we check if
 * the number is odd or even and print them.
 * 
 * When the odd thread starts running, the value of the variable number will be
 * 1. Since it is less than the maxValue and the flag isEvenNumber is false,
 * printOdd() is called. In the method, we check if the flag isOdd is true and
 * while it is true we call wait(). Since isOdd is false initially, wait() is
 * not called, and the value is printed.
 * 
 * We then set the value of isOdd to true, so that the odd thread goes into the
 * wait state and call notify() to wake up the even thread. The even thread then
 * wakes up and prints the even number since the odd flag is false. It then
 * calls notify() to wake up the odd thread.
 * 
 * The same process is carried out until the value of the variable number is
 * greater than the maxValue.
