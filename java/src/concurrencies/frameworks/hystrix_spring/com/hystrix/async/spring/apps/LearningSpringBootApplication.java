/**
 * The @SpringBootApplication annotation tells Spring Boot, when launched, to
 * scan recursively for Spring components inside this package and register them.
 * It also tells Spring Boot to enable autoconfiguration, a process where beans
 * are automatically created based on classpath settings, property settings, and
 * other factors. We'll see more of this throughout the book. Finally, it
 * indicates that this class itself can be a source for Spring bean definitions. <br/>
 * It holds public static void main() , a simple method to run the application.
 * There is no need to drop this code into an application server or servlet
 * container. We can just run it straight up, inside our IDE. The amount of time
 * saved by this feature, over the long haul, adds up fast. <br/>
 * SpringApplication.run() points Spring Boot at the leap-off point--â€‹ in this
 * case, this very class. But it's possible to run other classes.
